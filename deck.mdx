## Introduction and Objective

The main objective of this application is to bring all the Hip-Hop artists at a place where they can show their skills and interests. They will get all the updates regarding the events happening in all over INDIA and can directly book their tickets through the application. They can either participate in the event or can just be a viewer. Artists can post about them and their skills.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose is to make every hip-hop artist come together and jam. To create a platform where they can showcase their talent. They share their titles won in various battles which will be an addition to the profile and skills. Artists will get exposure for the art they perform. Organizing and promotion will become much easier for underground events.
